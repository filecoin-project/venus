// Actor is the central abstraction of entities in the system.
//
// Both individual accounts, as well as contracts (user & system level) are
// represented as actors. An actor has the following core functionality implemented on a system level:
// - track a Filecoin balance, using the `Balance` field
// - execute code stored in the `Code` field
// - read & write memory
// - replay protection, using the `Nonce` field
//
// Value sent to a non-existent address will be tracked as an empty actor that has a Balance but
// nil Code and Memory. You must nil check Code cids before comparing them.
//
// More specific capabilities for individual accounts or contract specific must be implemented
// inside the code.
//
// Not safe for concurrent access.
