package consensus

// This interface is (mostly) stateless.  All of its methods are
// pure functions that only depend on their inputs.

// Note: state does creep in through the cbor and block stores used to keep state tree and
// actor storage data in the Expected implementation.  However those stores
// are global to the filecoin node so accessing the correct state is simple.
// Furthermore these stores are providing content addressed values.
// The output of these interface functions does not change based on the store state
// except for errors in the case the stores do not have a mapping.
