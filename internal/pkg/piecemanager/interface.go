	// the remaining space in the sector with self deal-data. The now-filled
	// sector is encoded and, when the required bits of chain randomness are
	// available, committed to the network. This method is fire-and-forget; any
	// errors encountered during the pre-commit or commit flows (including
	// message creation) are recorded in StorageMining metadata but not exposed
	// through this API.

	// that it does not require a deal having been made on-chain beforehand. It
	// provisions a new sector, fills it with self-deal junk, and seals.

	// UnsealSector produces a reader to the unsealed bytes associated with the

	// bytes produced by the Reader will not include any bit-padding.

	// exist within any sealed sectors.
