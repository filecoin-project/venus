## What is Filecoin?
Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that turns the world’s unused storage into an algorithmic market, creating a permanent, decentralized future for the web. **Miners** earn the native protocol token (also called “filecoin”) by providing data storage and/or retrieval. **Clients** pay miners to store or distribute data and to retrieve it. Check out [How Filecoin Works](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/wiki/How-Filecoin-Works) for more.

**WARNING**: `go-filecoin` is a work in progress and is not ready for production use.
See [KNOWN_ISSUES](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/blob/master/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for an outline of known vulnerabilities.

## Install

👋 Welcome to Go Filecoin!

<!--
- To **run** `go-filecoin` for mining, storing or other exploring, jump straight to
  [detailed setup instructions](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/wiki/Getting-Started).
- To **build** `go-filecoin` from source for development, keep following this README.
-->

### System Requirements

Filecoin can build and run on most Linux and MacOS systems with at least 8GB of RAM. Windows is not yet supported.

<!--
### Install from Release Binary

- We host prebuilt binaries for Linux and OSX at [Releases](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/releases/). Log in with Github.
- Follow the remaining steps in [Start running Filecoin](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/wiki/Getting-Started#start-running-filecoin)
-->

### Install from Source

Clone the git repository:

```sh
mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/filecoin-project
git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin.git ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin
```

Now install the tools and dependencies listed below. If you have **any problems building go-filecoin**, see the [Troubleshooting & FAQ](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/wiki/Troubleshooting-&-FAQ) Wiki page.

#### Install Go and Rust

The build process for go-filecoin requires:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= v1.13
  - Installing Go for the first time? We recommend [this tutorial](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2016/05/installing-go-and-your-workspace.html) which includes environment setup.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) >= v1.36.0 and `cargo`
- `pkg-config` - used by go-filecoin to handle generating linker flags
  - Mac OS devs can install through brew `brew install pkg-config`

Due to our use of `cgo`, you'll need a C compiler to build go-filecoin whether you're using a prebuilt libsector_builder_ffi (our cgo-compatible rust-fil-proofs library) or building it yourself from source. If you want to use `gcc` (e.g. `export CC=gcc`) when building go-filecoin, you will need to use v7.4.0 or higher.
  - You must have libclang on you linker search path in order to build
    rust-fil-proofs from source. You can satisfy this requirement in most
    environments by installing Clang using your favorite package manager.

#### Install Dependencies

`go-filecoin` depends on some proofs code written in Rust, housed in the
[rust-fil-proofs](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs) repo and consumed as a submodule. You will need to have `cargo` and `jq` installed.

First we need to load all the submodules.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To install golangci-lint and other build and test dependencies (with precompiled
proofs, recommended), run:

```sh
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin
FILECOIN_USE_PRECOMPILED_RUST_PROOFS=true go run ./build deps
```

Note: The first time you run `deps` can be **slow** as a ~1.6GB parameter file is either downloaded or generated locally in `/var/tmp/filecoin-proof-parameters`.
Have patience; future runs will be faster.

#### Build, Run Tests, and Install

```sh
# First, build the binary
go run ./build build

# Then, run the unit tests.
go run ./build test

# Build and test can be combined!
go run ./build best
```

Other handy build commands include:

```sh
# Check the code for style and correctness issues
go run ./build lint

# Run different categories of tests by toggling their flags
go run ./build test -unit=false -integration=true -functional=true

# Test with a coverage report
go run ./build test -cover

# Test with Go's race-condition instrumentation and warnings (see https://blog.golang.org/race-detector)
go run ./build test -race

# Deps, Lint, Build, Test (any args will be passed to `test`)
go run ./build all
```

Note: Any flag passed to `go run ./build test` (e.g. `-cover`) will be passed on to `go test`.

If you have **problems with the build**, please see the [Troubleshooting & FAQ](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/wiki/Troubleshooting-&-FAQ) Wiki page.


#### Manage Submodules Manually (optional)

If you're editing `rust-fil-proofs`, you need to manage the submodule manually. If you're *not* editing `rust-fil-proofs` you can relax:
`deps` build (above) will do it for you. You may need to run `deps` again after pulling master if the submodule is
updated by someone else (it will appear modified in `git status`).

To initialize the submodule:

```sh
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin
git submodule update --init
```

Later, when the head of the `rust-fil-proofs` `master` branch changes, you may want to update `go-filecoin` to use these changes:

```sh
git submodule update --remote
```

Note that updating the `rust-fil-proofs` submodule in this way will require a commit to `go-filecoin` (changing the submodule hash).

## Usage

The [Getting Started](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page contains
a simple sequence to get your Filecoin node up and running and connected to a devnet.

The [Commands](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/wiki/Commands) page contains further detail about
specific commands and environment variables, as well as scripts for for setting up a miner and making a deal.

To see a full list of commands, run `go-filecoin --help`.

### Advanced usage

#### Setting up a localnet

The localnet FAST binary tool allows users to quickly and easily setup a local network on the users computer. Please refer to the [localnet README](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/tree/master/tools/fast/bin/localnet#localnet) for more information. The localnet tool is only compatible when built from the same git ref as the targeted `go-filecoin` binary.

these developer networks and instructions for connecting your nodes to them.
