## What is Filecoin?
Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that turns the world‚Äôs unused storage into an algorithmic market, creating a permanent, decentralized future for the web.
**Miners** earn the native protocol token (also called ‚ÄúFilecoin‚Äù) by providing data storage and/or retrieval. 
**Clients** pay miners to store or distribute data and to retrieve it.
Check out the [Filecoin website](https://filecoin.io/) and [Filecoin Documentation](https://docs.filecoin.io/) for more.

## Install

üëã Welcome to Go Filecoin!

This README outlines the basics for building and running Go-filecoin.
**For more background, configuration, and troubleshooting information check out the [Go-filecoin Docs](https://go.filecoin.io/)**.

### System Requirements

Go-filecoin can build and run on most Linux and MacOS systems. 
Windows is not yet supported.

A validating node can run on most systems with at least 8GB of RAM. 
A mining node requires significant RAM and GPU resources, depending on the sector configuration to be used.

### Install from Source on MacOS
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/master/scripts/build/mac-build.sh
```

### Install from Source

Clone this git repository to your machine:

```sh
mkdir -p /path/to/filecoin-project
git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin.git /path/to/filecoin-project/go-filecoin
```

#### Install Go

The build process for go-filecoin requires [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= v1.13

> Installing Go for the first time? We recommend [this tutorial](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2016/05/installing-go-and-your-workspace.html) which includes environment setup.

Due to our use of `cgo`, you'll need a C compiler to build go-filecoin whether you're using a prebuilt library or building it yourself from source. 
If you want to use `gcc` (e.g. `export CC=gcc`) when building go-filecoin, you will need to use v7.4.0 or higher.

The build process will download a static library containing the [Filecoin proofs implementation](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs) (which is written in Rust).

> If instead you wish to build proofs from source, you'll need (1) Rust development environment and (2) to set the environment variable `FFI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1`.
More info at [filecoin-ffi](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-ffi).

#### Install Dependencies

First, load all the Git submodules.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Initialize build dependencies.

```sh
make deps
```

Note: The first time you run `deps` can be **slow** as very large parameter files are either downloaded or generated locally in `/var/tmp/filecoin-proof-parameters`.
Have patience; future runs will be faster.

#### Build and run tests

```sh
# First, build the binary
make

# Then, run the unit tests.
go run ./build test

# Build and test can be combined!
go run ./build best
```

Other handy build commands include:

```sh
# Check the code for style and correctness issues
go run ./build lint

# Run different categories of tests by toggling their flags
go run ./build test -unit=false -integration=true -functional=true

# Test with a coverage report
go run ./build test -cover

# Test with Go's race-condition instrumentation and warnings (see https://blog.golang.org/race-detector)
go run ./build test -race

# Deps, Lint, Build, Test (any args will be passed to `test`)
go run ./build all
```

Note: Any flag passed to `go run ./build test` (e.g. `-cover`) will be passed on to `go test`.

If you have **problems with the build**, please consult the [Troubleshooting](https://go.filecoin.io/go-filecoin-tutorial/Troubleshooting-&-FAQ.html) section of the [Go-filecoin Documentation](https://go.filecoin.io/).

## Usage

For a complete step-by-step tutorial, see [Getting Started](https://go.filecoin.io/go-filecoin-tutorial/Getting-Started.html).

#### Quick start:

```sh
# Remove any existing symlink to a repo directory
rm ~/.filecoin

# Initialize a new repository, downloading a genesis file and setting network parameters (in this case, for the Testnet network)
go-filecoin init --genesisfile=https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXZQeezX1x8uRQX9EUaYxnyivUpTfJqQTvszk3c8SnFPN/testnet.car --network=testnet

# Start the daemon.  It will block until it connects to at least one bootstrap peer.
go-filecoin daemon
```

Your node should now be connected to some peers, and begin downloading and validating the blockchain.

Open a new terminal to interact with your node:

```sh
# Print the node's connection information
go-filecoin id

# Show chain sync status
go-filecoin chain status
```

To see a full list of commands, run `./go-filecoin --help`.

### Advanced usage

#### Setting up a localnet

The localnet FAST binary tool allows users to quickly and easily setup a local network on the users computer. 
Please refer to the [localnet README](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/tree/master/tools/fast/bin/localnet#localnet) for more information. 
The localnet tool is only compatible when built from the same git ref as the targeted `go-filecoin` binary.
