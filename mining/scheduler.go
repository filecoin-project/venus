package mining

// The Scheduler listens for new heaviest TipSets and schedules mining work on
// these TipSets.  The scheduler is ultimately responsible for informing the
// rest of the system about new blocks mined by the Worker.  This is the
// interface to implement if you want to explore an alternate mining strategy.
//
// The default Scheduler implementation, timingScheduler, is an attempt to
// prevent miners from getting interrupted by attackers strategically releasing
// better base tipsets midway through a proving period. Such attacks are bad
// because they causes miners to waste work.  Note that the term 'base tipset',
// or 'mining base' is used to denote the tipset that the miner uses as the
// parent of the block it attempts to generate during mining.
//
// The timingScheduler operates in two states, 'collect', where the scheduler
// listens for new heaviest tipsets to use as the best mining base, and 'ignore',
// where mining proceeds uninterrupted.  The scheduler enters the 'collect' state
// each time a new heaviest tipset arrives with a greater height.  The
// scheduler finishes the collect state after the mining delay time, a protocol
// parameter, has passed.  The scheduler then enters the 'ignore' state.  Here
// the scheduler mines, ignoring all inputs with the most recent and lower
// heights.  'ignore' concludes when the scheduler receives an input tipset,
// possibly the tipset consisting of the block the miner just mined, with
// a greater height, and transitions back to collect.  It is in miners'
// best interest to wait for the collection period so that they can wait to
// work on a base tipset made up of all blocks mined at the new height.
//
// The current approach is limited. It does not prevent wasted work from all
// strategic block witholding attacks.  This is also going to be effected by
// current unknowns surrounding the specifics of the mining protocol (i.e. how
// do VDFs and PoSTs fit into mining, and what is the lookback parameter for
// challenge sampling.  For more details see:
// https://gist.github.com/whyrusleeping/4c05fd902f7123bdd1c729e3fffed797

// Scheduler is the mining interface consumers use. When you Start() the
// scheduler it returns two channels (inCh, outCh) and a sync.WaitGroup:
//   - inCh: the caller sends Inputs to mine on to this channel.
//   - outCh: the scheduler sends Outputs to the caller on this channel.
//   - doneWg: signals that the scheduler and any goroutines it launched
//             have stopped. (Context cancelation happens async, so you
//             need some way to know when it has actually stopped.)
//
// Once Start()ed, the Scheduler can be stopped by canceling its miningCtx,
// which will signal on doneWg when it's actually done. Canceling miningCtx
// cancels any run in progress and shuts the scheduler down.
